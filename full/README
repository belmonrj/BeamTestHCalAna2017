This directory makes the energy resolution and linearity for the full calorimeter system.
Though not set up yet, it's possible to make different selections on where the shower originates,
as was done in the 2016 beam test paper.

Resolution_generic.C is the macro that makes the resolution and linearity plots along with
an output root file with various histograms.

balance_emcal_weight.C calculates weights for the resolution macro (exact purpose TBD).
