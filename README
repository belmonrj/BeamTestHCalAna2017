CDR_compare_plot.C --- draws a single panel 1d distribution comparing self- and external triggering (see also self_check macros belowa)

DrawPrototype2HCAL.C --- draws 1d distribution for each tower (needs work)

Fun4All_scan.C --- runs Fun4All to produce output (haven't tried this yet to see what exactly you get)

Fun4All_scan.sh --- calls Fun4All_scan.C, called by submit.py and submit_full.py (see below)

balance_emcal_weight.C --- calculates weights for the EMCal (used in Resolution_generic macros)

compare_data.C --- draws resolution and linearity vs energy for both pi+ and pi-

compare_signal_sim.C --- draws 1d distribution comparison between simulation and real data

cosmics macros --- draw 1d ADC distributions from cosmics for various detectors, comparisons are between prototype2 (2016) and prototype3 (2017)
cosmics_hcal_compare.C
cosmics_hcalin.C
cosmics_hcalin_compare.C
cosmics_hcalout.C
cosmics_hcalout_compare.C

hcal_balance.C --- draws 2d hcal energy assymmetry vs energy and 1d profile on top

Resolution_generic.C --- draws 1d energy distributions, resolution and linearity vs energy, HCal only
Resolution_generic_FullCalo.C --- draws 1d energy distributions, resolution and linearity vs energy, full calorimeter system

plot_hcal.C --- draws 1d ADC distributions for each tower (needs work)

self_check.C --- draws 1d ADC distributions comparing BNL and FNAL (external and self-triggering)
self_check2.C --- draws 1d ADC distributions comparing BNL and FNAL (external and self-triggering) but input files appear to be missing

submit.py --- python script to run Fun4All
submit_full.py --- python script to run Fun4All
